# FIN (Fund In Need)

Overview

FIN (Fund In Need) give a solution for enhancing creditworthiness in decentralized finance (DeFi) by tokenizing users' on-chain credit scores into ERC-1155 tokens, referred to as FIN Tokens. These tokens represent a user's financial reputation and can be used as collateral on lending platforms like Aave. By leveraging on subgraphs provided by The Graph's, we aim to create a system where users can monetize their creditworthiness, access better loan terms, and participate more fully in the DeFi ecosystem.
In one line, we allow people to borrow money, by collaterizing their social credit. The more legit they are, they can borrow more money.

_Sus people = low credit = cannot borrow money._
